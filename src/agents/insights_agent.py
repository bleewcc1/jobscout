"""Insights Agent: turns aggregate skill-gap statistics into a short,
actionable focus suggestion.

COURSE CONCEPT (multi-agent system): a fourth specialist sub-agent,
dispatched on demand (not per job) — it operates on aggregate stats from
src/insights.py (already-scored dimension numbers + reasons), never on a
raw job posting, so there is no untrusted-input surface here the way
there is for scoring/drafting.
